# PROJECT: 
Logo Sign for Door

# SOLUTION: 
I propose we make a total control Lighting implementation for a sign and possible outdoor building coolness.

Mount pixels to some circular cut plywood, with a large dense cluster of pixels. Say a 2-3 foot diameter wood/metal round with 200-300 pixels. 
These are RGB LED Roll lights with modular controller so you can define each LED light, 3 LED per "pixel" . 60 pixel per meter.
This project has everything arduino, design of the cluster of strip lights, and software programming of LED pixels.
All good shit from coolneon.com in Oakland.

# POWER: 
Id like to make it Power over Ethernet. 

# RESULT: 
To make DMS logo that can osscillate through a gajillion different colors. That can change periodically and is solar powered. Maybe we can do more lights, physics is involved.
