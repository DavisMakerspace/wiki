# Electronic Entry to the Space

We need a cool electronic entry system to our space!

Feel free to brainstorm ideas here.  Unless otherwise specified, lists here are meant to be exhaustive, and not necessarily design goals..!

Clearly this is just a stub right now.  Please add more!

## Authentication Methods

- RFID
- QR Code
    - Could be useful for more temporary authorization types
- Facial recognition
- Thumbprint
- Electronic manual override
- Physical manual override

## Authorization Types
 
- Persistent authorization for e.g. members in good standing
- One-day/one-time authorization for e.g. guests

## Management

- Authorize an authentication via multiple interfaces
    - IRC
    - Website
    - Kiosk in space

## Monitoring

- Announce entry/exit on IRC
