# Electronic Entry to the Space

We need a cool electronic entry system to our space!

Feel free to brainstorm ideas here.  Unless otherwise specified, lists here are meant to be exhaustive, and not necessarily design goals..!

Clearly this is just a stub right now.  Please add more!

## Authentication Methods

- RFID
    - Good for longer-term authorizations, e.g. members in good standing.
    - Unlike QR, no visibility of key required, just proximity.
- QR Code
    - Good for temporary authorizations.
    - Easy to cancel and regenerate in case of loss.
    - Less convenient since requires visibility.
    - Cheaper per key vs RFID.
- Facial recognition
- Thumbprint
- Electronic manual override
- Physical manual override
- Login and unlock via local WiFi
- Knock code
    - e.g. have to tap a certain rhythm to unlock.  Though any means of 'tapping' could be possible, e.g. flashing a light, making sounds, etc.
    - probably best for limited time or one-time authentications.

## Authorization Types
 
- Persistent authorization for e.g. members in good standing
- One-day/one-time authorization for e.g. guests
- Dependent on certain conditions, e.g.
    - only in given time frame
    - someone already in the space

## Management

- Authorize an authentication via multiple interfaces
    - IRC
    - Website
    - Kiosk in space

## Monitoring

- Announce entry/exit on IRC
