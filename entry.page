# Electronic Entry to the Space

We need a cool electronic entry system to our space!

Feel free to brainstorm ideas here.  Unless otherwise specified, lists here are meant to be exhaustive, and not necessarily design goals..!

Clearly this is just a stub right now.  Please add more!

## Authentication Methods

- RFID
    - Good for longer-term authorizations, e.g. members in good standing.
    - Unlike QR, no visibility of key required, just proximity.
- [QR Code Entry]()
    - Good for temporary authorizations.
    - Easy to cancel and regenerate in case of loss.
    - Less convenient since requires visibility.
    - Cheaper per key vs RFID.
    - Could be implemented with a Raspberry PI and a webcam [example project](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2504)
- Facial recognition
- Thumbprint
- Electronic manual override
- Physical manual override
- Login and unlock via local WiFi
- Knock code
    - e.g. have to tap a certain rhythm to unlock.  Though any means of 'tapping' could be possible, e.g. flashing a light, making sounds, etc.
    - probably best for limited time or one-time authentications.
- [USB key entry]()
    - could be dual-use with dead-drop port
- Bluetooth pairing

## Authorization Types
 
- Persistent authorization for e.g. members in good standing
- One-day/one-time authorization for e.g. guests
- Dependent on certain conditions, e.g.
    - only in given time frame
    - someone already in the space

## Management

- Authorize an authentication via multiple interfaces
    - IRC
    - Website
    - Kiosk in space

## Monitoring

- Announce entry/exit on IRC
- Could run a user created script at door open, like on login

## Possible data to store:

- Code
- Date/Time created, used, expires
- Created by/for
- Status (active, expired, revoked)

## Relevant external projects

- An [Electric Strike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_strike) would allow us to keep our current key/deadbolt option and mean less work on the door and frame.  Thanks to Tim for the suggestion!
