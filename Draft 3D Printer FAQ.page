##3D Printer FAQ - taken from Mick's class notes##  

What applications should I install so that I can design and print 3D parts?  
*[Sketchup](http://www.sketchup.com/)  
[STL plugin for Sketchup](http://extensions.sketchup.com/en/content/sketchup-stl)  
[Netfab basic](http://www.netfabb.com/basic.php)  
[Slic3r](http://slic3r.org/download)  
[Pronterface](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun)*  
  
What unit of measure should I use with my design?  
*CM (centimeter)*  
  
What are the bed sizes of our printers?  
*The small plywood printer bed is 100mm x 100mm, the large plywood printer is 200mm x 200mm.*  
  
How do I create an array of identical parts?  
*Use Slic3r.*  
  
What is Infill?  
*The solid or honeycomb structure of the solid portions of a part.*  
  
What is a Support?  
*A temporary scaffold inside a part to support a solid portion above it.*  
  
What is a Skirt?  
*A flat area printed around the perimeter of the part.  It serves to reduce warping and to anchor the part.*  
  
What is a Brim?  
*An area printed under the part.  It also reduces warping, but must be cut away after the part is made.*  
  
Can I use the default Printerbot speeds on our plywood printers?  
*No, they are too fast.*  
  
How do I set up Printerbot?  
*Refer to the Printerbot Getting Started Guide and Braden?s Awesome Settings for Simple Printerbot.*  
  
What sizes of filament can I use?  
*Filament comes 1.75mm or 3.0 mm diameter, usually on a 1kg reel.*  
  
What type of filament materials are available?  
*PLA, ABS and Nylon.*  
  
Where can I buy known high-quality filament?  
*Filament from Printerbot is high quality at a good price.*  
  
What temperature should I run the extruder at for the different filaments?  
*PLA - 185 to 190 deg C.*  
*ABS - 200 to 220 deg C.*  
*Nylon - 240 deg C.*  
  
What are the characteristics of PLA?  
*PLA does not shrink, is made from corn, it smells pleasant when printing and it needs a fan.*  
  
What are the characteristics of ABS?  
*ABS makes stronger parts, but it shrinks, needs a heated bed and it?s smell is somewhat unpleasant.*  
  
What size nozzles are used?  
*Our machines use 0.4mm nozzles.*  
  
What is a good way to get a part to stick to a glass bed?  
*Apply some Elmer?s orange glue stick to the bed before printing the part.*  
  
What is an alternative to Pronterface?  
*Repetier. But it doesn't work on older printers.*  
  
How can I fix internal planes in my part?  
*With Netfab.  It also has Slic3r built in, but it doesn?t work with some older printers.*  
  
Where can I see a demo of Mick's hot foam cutter software?  
*On his [Makertoolkit](http://makertoolkit.com:3000/#home) site.*
