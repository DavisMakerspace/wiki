### Tower Storage


Fastenal Pipes across legs to strap tower to. We will use pipe to lay the tower on and fasten the tower to the pipe with a strap. 
Pipe will need to be 1 and 5'8 th diameter and we will need 

2 pieces of pipe 
4 cross fasteners - 90Â° offset crossover joint which is an L45-7 crossover [joint](https://www.google.com/search?q=L45-7+crossover&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8) -  

We also need some pipe coming out the top perpendicular to the surface of the table and taking a right angle or so 1 meter above the surface of the sand.

Pipe diameter: 1-5/8" outside diameter, wall thickness of 3/16". According to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_Pipe_Size#NPS_.E2.85.9B_to_NPS_3.C2.BD), that is 1-1/4" Schedule 80 pipe **(double check)**
