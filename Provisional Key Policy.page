## Purpose of Provisional Key Policy ##
This policy describes the current Davis Makerspace approach for providing key access to the Davis Makerspace facilities. The intent of this policy is to provide a temporary guideline for distributing key access until a more formalized policy is established. A more formalized policy can be proposed at any time. As a provisional policy,
however, the approach described below generally uses existing mechanisms defined by current Davis Makerspace Bylaws. This policy does not necessarily limit other methods for distributing key access, but is intended to function as the recommended method.

## Process ##
Key access will be considered on a case by case basis, and granted upon consensus vote as defined in the Davis Makerspace Bylaws. The general process for key-holdership consideration shall be as follows:

1. Submit a Proposal for Key Access,
2. Submit an optional Statement of Nomination,
3. the board will arrange public meeting to consider the proposal,
4. the proposal will be accepted or declined by consensus vote, and
5. if the proposal is accepted, key-holdership will be granted, subject to any conditions stated in the accepted proposal.

## Details of Process Elements ##

### Proposal for Key Access ###

Due to the wide variety of reasons and opinions on why keys should or should not be distributed, key access will be considered on a case by case basis. To aid consideration, potential key-holders should provide a Proposal for Key Access. The Proposal for Key Access shall be a written statement describing why the potential key-holder should have key access to Davis Makerspace facilities. If accepted by consensus 
vote, as prescribed by the Davis Makerspace Bylaws, the Proposal for Key Access will also function as an agreement with the Davis Makerspace Corporation and state the conditions for key access. Therefore, any potential conditions related to the key access should be included in the Proposal for Key Access. Potential key-holders can propose any conditions or reasoning they see fit in justifying key access. However, since the 
proposal is subject to consensus vote as defined in the Davis Makerspace Bylaws, the contents of proposal should include provisions that all eligible voting members will be agreeable to. The Proposal for Key Access will be provided to the public prior to voting, and will typically remain available for public review after any vote. To provide initial examples of proposals, existing key-holders will be asked to prepare thier own Proposal for Key Access based on thier exisiting key holding arrangements. These proposals would available for public review along with future proposals.

### Statement Granting Unlimited Key Revocation Rights to the Board ###

In considering Proposals for Key Access, the Board of Directors, would prefer the following statement be included as part of any Proposal for Key Access: 

<blockquote>
If granted key access, I, _(name of proposed key-holder)_, understand that key access to any Davis Makerspace facility can  be revoked, by any Davis Makerspace Board Member, for any reason, without limit. I will have the opportunity to appeal any
revocation by consensus vote, as described by Davis Makerspace Bylaws, but the revocation of key access will remain in placeuntil properly relinquished by the appeal.</blockquote>


This statement will not be required as part of the Proposal for Key Access, but the absence of this statement may be favored negatively by voting parties.

### Statement of Nomination ###

In addition to a Proposal for Key Access, potential key-holders are encouraged to submit a written Statement of Nomination prepared by any party other than themselves. The Statement of Nomination is optional, but will help establish the level of involvement the potential key-holder has with members of the Davis Makerspace community, and as
such, is encouraged. The Statement of Nomination may be prepared by anyone, but since it will be subject to consensus vote, as described by the Davis Makerspace Bylaws, the preparing party should generally be selected to satisfy all eligible voting members. Like the Proposal for Key Access, the Statement of Nomination will be provided to all eligible voters prior to voting, and will typically remain available for public 
review after any vote.

### Public Meeting to Consider the Proposal ###

Upon receipt of the Proposal for Key-Access and if applicable, the Statement of Nomination, a meeting will be arranged by the Board of Directors, typically by the President or Secretary of the Davis Makerspace Corporation, per the Davis Makerspace Bylaws. In general, this meeting will be a public meeting, providing adequate notice and 
proxy voting, as described in the Davis Makespace By-laws. Furthermore, since the proposed key-holder will be ineligible from voting on their own Proposal for Key Access, an effort will be made to schedule the meeting separately from general meetings. In general, votes to accept or not accept the proposal will be conducted at the meeting. Voting will be by consensus vote as defined by the Davis Makerspace Bylaws.

### Acceptance and Conditions of the Proposal for Key Access ###

If the Proposal for Key Access is accepted by consensus vote as defined by the Davis Makerspace Bylaws, the conditions described in the Proposal for Key Access will govern the key holdership. The Proposal for Key Access will be typically be available for public review, and may be amended by additional proposals, provided they comply with Davis Makerspace Bylaws.
