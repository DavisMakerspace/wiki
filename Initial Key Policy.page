In the absence of any official policy, we have been acting (necessarily) on a case-by-case and *ad hoc* manner in regards to key access and open-door expectations. 

This outline is intended to be a common-ground starting point: a baseline policy foundation from which future policy can be built and evolved.

## Key Policy

* No physical keys; only digital keys
    * We'll "call back" all physical keys
    * Only issue physical keys to board members and maintenance/staff
* To get digital key
    * Must be member
        * Application (free) on file
        * Signed liability waiver on file
    * Must be familiar/known to the space
        * Attend 3+ meetings or 1 meeting and 2+ open houses
    * Must commit to donating back to the community
        * Money and/or accepted tools
        * Hold open hours
        * Teach a class
        * Help clean up after open house
        * ...
        * Simply share your ideas
* Key access is logged
    * Any problems, a committee will investigate
    * Digital keys can be revoked at will, based on committee findings
    * Revocation can be temporary

The general philosophy behind this **key policy** is

1. Everyone in the Davis community should have access to the space
2. Access is contingent on "acceptable" and "safe" behavior"
3. The space operates for and by the community: there needs to be a symbiotic relationship.

One of the acceptable methods of donating back to the community is the agreement to hold regular open hours.  Holding open hours is an agreement to let people (ie, those without a key) into the space and be responsible for any mishaps.  If you are holding open hours, you have the freedom/authority to deny or withdraw access to tools, space, etc.  This includes requesting people leave the space.

If you come into the space when it is not a scheduled time for open hours, you are not required to host the space for others.  Ie, you are free to close the door behind you.  If you do let non-keyholders in, however, you are responsible for their actions.
