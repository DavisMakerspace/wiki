The following is the wiki version of that text, and any differences from the policy as described in the above announcement should be thought only as clarifications or suggestions.

## Philosophy

The general philosophy behind this key policy is

1. Everyone in the Davis community should have access to the space
2. Access is contingent on "acceptable" and "safe" behavior"
3. The space operates for and by the community: there needs to be a symbiotic relationship.

One of the acceptable methods of donating back to the community is the agreement to hold regular open hours.  Holding open hours is an agreement to let people (ie, those without a key) into the space and be responsible for any mishaps.  If you are holding open hours, you have the freedom/authority to deny or withdraw access to tools, space, etc.  This includes requesting people leave the space.

If you come into the space when it is not a scheduled time for open hours, you are not required to host the space for others.  Ie, you are free to close the door behind you.  If you do let non-keyholders in, however, you are responsible for their actions.
