This page is here to help facilitate the development of our key access policy.  This discussion is wholly intended for anyone involved with DMS.  The conversation has been going on for sometime, and lots of ideas have been put forth, so it is important that we hear everyone's voice and address everyone's concerns. This is a policy that we are developing together (everyone included) and nothing has been set in stone at this point. The whole goal here is to prepare a proposal for a future vote, one that would be agreeable enough to pass by consensus.

If you have input that you believe needs to be incorporated into any new policies, please speak up!

# Model Options

A few different approaches for granting key access have already been proposed.  Below is a short list of these ideas.  If you have more ideas, please add them!

**Sponsorship Model** - A system where existing key holding members would sponsor new key holders (and potentially take responsibility for any issues that might arise if a key-holdership went awry).

**Fee Model** - Potential key holding members could make monetary donations to the space in effort to build trust and accountability.  This was essentially the model we removed from our bylaws in June to help conform our our organization to needs of the State Non-Profit Application.  Portions of this model to potentially be revived, as long as it is not creating an exclusive class of members, (i.e. creating a pay-to-play arrangement).  If implemented in combination with other means of gaining key-holdership, we would probably still comply with the State requirements for non-profit status.

**Volunteer Work Model** - Key-holdership could be granted if potential key-holders commit to volunteer tasks.  Tasks might include: holding open hours, managing a donations program, maintaining a tools or materials database, or other such task.   

**Combination of Models** - Any of the above models could be combined to create a multi-pronged approach to key-holdership.

# Responsibilities Associated with Key-Holdership

A number of people have suggested that key-holdership should imply some level of responsibility to the space.  This would foster personal investment for key-holders, and development a needs based philosophy towards key-holdership.  These responsibilities could be distributed across different key-holders or apply to all key-holders equally. Example responsibilities might include:

- Periodically cleaning the space

- Training people on equipment

- Restocking vending machines

Please add more ideas if you have any or comment on anything you find problematic.

# Procedure Options for Gaining Key Access

Part of the development of the key access policy should include the procedural approach to gaining key access.  Any of the ideas below could be implemented individually or in combination with each other.  Many of these procedure options would be dependent on the model options we decide to include in our key policy.  Selecting a procedure would be somewhat iterative with the selection of our model options. Either way, please add other ideas if you have any!

**Automatic** - Key-holders would simply have to meet a prescribed set of requirements, (making three months worth of $30 donations), and key-holdership is automatically granted.

**Vote** - Key access could be granted to proposed key-holders by vote.  A proposed key-holder could present a case for key-holdership, and request a vote at a meeting.  Key-holdership would be granted on a successful vote.

**Committee Review** - A proposed key-holder could apply to a committee for key-holdership.  The committee would either accept or reject the application.

# Revocation of Key Access

Our key-access policy should also include a means for revoking key access when needed.  Some suggestions are included below.  Please add more ideas if you have any!

- Discontinuation of regular donations

- Discontinuation of regular volunteer activities

- Significant violation of DMS rules or policies

- Voting
