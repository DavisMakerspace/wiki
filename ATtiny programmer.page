# ATtiny programmer

We could have a public Arduino set up as a ISP for ATTiny chips.

## Cost
- Arduino: ~$20 (I (Wesley) have the components to make the rest of the ISP.)
- ATtiny: ~$2.56-$2.66 per chip (Depending on model of chip)
- Computer: Free (Use threed computer as a threed/arduino comuter)

Keep in mind that the ATtinys can be reprogrammed multiple times per chip, keeping the cost of experimenting with the chips down.

## Chips
Assuming we would order from sparkfun, there are 3 options:
1.  ATtiny84
    a. Cost: $2.66 each per 10 chips.
    b. I/O Pins: 12
    c. Program space: 8K
2.  ATtiny85
    a. Cost: $2.56 each per 10 chips.
    b. I/O Pins: 6
    c. Program space: 8K
3.  ATtiny2313
    a. Cost: $2.59 each per 10 chips.
    b. I/O Pins: 15
    c. Program space: 2K
