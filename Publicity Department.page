## Davis Flea Market display, July 2013

Several members put on a display at the Davis Flea Market on Sunday, July 28, 2013. The organizers let us take over a small office inside their warehouse on Olive Drive. James showed his beautiful handmade beehive (sans bees!); Ben and Colin worked on their role-playing terrain model; and Tim F. brought in a pair of tabletop Van de Graaf high-voltage generators and a remotely-operated camera bot.

Several other members were there, too: Braden, Jordan, Steve, Bill (apologies to any not listed!)... a good time was had by all. We answered many questions from interested visitors, and we passed out lots of "Hot Fun in the Summertime" flyers.

We realized that we could use a big banner or sign to put up at such events... any volunteers?

##"MADE IN YOLO COUNTY" Newspaper Articles, July 2013

Tom Sakash and Wayne Tilcock from the Davis Enterprise visited us
in late June. We talked to them and showed them our space and some
of our member's projects, and they wrote a nice article about us.
They published it as part of their annual "Made In Yolo County" supplement;
it appeared in their Sunday edition on July 7, 2013.

The Friday after that supplement appeared, we received many new
visitors who said they had learned about us from that article.
So, the article was great publicity for us. Thank you, Davis Enterprise!

Here are two links to online versions of the material that appeared in that supplement.
