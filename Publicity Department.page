##"MADE IN YOLO" Newspaper Articles, July 2013

Tom Sakash and Wayne Tilcock from the Davis Enterprise visited us
in late June. We talked to them and showed them our space and some
of our member's projects, and they wrote a nice article about us.
They published it as part of their annual "Made In Yolo" supplement;
it appeared in their Sunday edition on July 7, 2013.

The Friday after that supplement appeared, we received many new
visitors who said they had learned about us from that article.
So, the article was great publicity for us. Thank you, Davis Enterprise!

Here are two links to online versions of the material that appeared in that supplement.
