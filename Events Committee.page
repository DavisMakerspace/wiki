At our October 7th, 2013 meeting it was proposed that an events committee be formed.  This page is to collect ideas about the proposed events committee.

Responsibilities might include:
- Maintaining a schedule for events at the space.
- Vetting proposed events.
- Working with the organizers of accepted events to coordinate resources.

The group might be made up of about 3 people.

Please add your thoughts to this page.
