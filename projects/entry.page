# Electronic Entry to the Space

We need a cool electronic entry system to our space!

Feel free to brainstorm ideas here.  Unless otherwise specified, lists here are meant to be exhaustive, and not necessarily design goals..!

Clearly this is just a stub right now.  Please add more!

## Authentication

  * RFID
  * QR Code
    * Possibly distinguish between persistent codes for monthly members and one-day/one-time use codes for guests etc.
    * Make it possible to manage authorized codes remotely (IRC?)


## Other projects

  * [Lockitron](https://lockitron.com/)
