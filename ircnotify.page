# ircnotify

ircnotify is a little bot that relays amything written into a UNIX socket to the IRC channel, acting as a general method to send notifications to the IRC channel.

For example:

    echo 'Hello world!' | socat stdin unix-connect:/run/ircnotify/dmsnotify

Or, in python:

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect("/run/ircnotify/dmsnotify")
    s.send("Hello world!")

Feel free to play around with it, or to come up with something else entirely.
