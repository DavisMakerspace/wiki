# ircnotify

ircnotify is a little bot that relays info from a UNIX socket to the IRC channel.

The idea is that it is a general purpose method to send notifications to the IRC channel.

On the server, an example one-liner to send a notification to the IRC channel:

    echo 'Hello world!' | socat stdin unix-connect:/run/ircnotify/dmsnotify
