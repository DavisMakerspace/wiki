# 3D Printer & Computer

There is a 3D printer (designed+built by Mick) in the space.

There is a Linux computer there meant to be used with it (running CrunchBang linux).

There is a user for the 3d Printer on that computer.  threed/Print_Stuff!

Further notes and instructions to follow.

For now, know that the software `slic3r` and some other one whose name is forgotten at the moment are in the command PATH.
