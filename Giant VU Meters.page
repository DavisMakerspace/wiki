title: Giant VU Meters Project
categories: projects

# The Basic Concept

Make a pair of giant digital VU meters, mounted on the east wall of our space
on either side of our projection screen.
The meters will usually be plugged into the stereo system so that they will show the relative loudness of whatever the stereo is playing.

This project is an installation project: It will produce a decorative / functional object permanently installed in our space. The project will show off some of the multiple talents
and skills of our members. It will be easily appreciated by visitors, and should add to
the coolness of our space!

A project team has been formed. Results will be publicly visible -- both in our space and on our wiki.

The project received the green light at our monthly meeting on July 1, 2013.
Work has started already.

# More Details

"VU meters" are those little gizmos on your stereo (or other audio electronics)
that show how strong / loud the audio signal is. The "VU" stands for "Volume Units".
There are two basic kinds of VU meter: An "analog" meter, which looks like a dial with a moving needle; and a "digital" meter, which usually looks like a little stack of colored indicator lights about one inch tall -- the more lights are on, the louder the sound. There are usually two VU meters -- one for each channel of your stereo.

Our VU meters will be digital, but they won't be inch-tall stacks of little lights...
each one will be about six feet tall and one foot wide.

Each will have ten big, bright L.E.D. lights.
The diffusers on the lights will be custom designs, fabricated using our own 3D printers.
They may include the Davis Makerspace logo that Emily designed -- a feature that
you can't buy anywhere!

# Time, Effort & Work Site

This is not a particularly complex project, although it does bring together aesthetics, design, and electronics.

There are three members on the project team: Tim F, Emily, and Mick. We expect to have the project finished this summer.

Primarily, Emily will design the custom diffusers, Mick will handle the 3D printing,
and Tim will build the electronics and the wooden support structure. Tim will document the project and will eventually post plans and instructions on our wiki.

The work will be done in our space, to the greatest extent possible.

# Liability

Very low. The VU meters use very little power; they will be powered by small UL-listed wall warts or laptop power supplies, which are fairly safe little gadgets. The L.E.D. lights don't run hot.

# Expenses

The project will come close to the limit of $150.00 that the Board has specified for such installation projects.

We will save some money by making the light diffusers with our own 3D printers.

# Resources

Tim has posted some concept sketches for this project:

# Next Steps

Progress should be fairly rapid.

Tim has bought all of the electronic and material parts.

Tim has also laid out the basic dimensions of the meters (see the concept sketches in the Resources section of this page):

- Each meter will be 72" tall, 11.25" wide, and 0.75" thick
- Each meter will have ten light diffusers

Emily and Mick can work on the diffusers at the same time as Tim builds the electronics and woodwork.

With any luck, this project will be complete this summer. Stay tuned for progress reports!
