title: Giant VU Meters Project

# The Basic Concept

Our original concept statement was:

"Make a pair of giant digital VU meters, mounted on the east wall of our space
on either side of our projection screen.
The meters will usually be plugged into the stereo system so that they will show the relative loudness of whatever the stereo is playing.

This project is an installation project: It will produce a decorative / functional object permanently installed in our space. The project will show off some of the multiple talents
and skills of our members. It will be easily appreciated by visitors, and should add to
the coolness of our space!"

That must have been a reasonable concept, because the finished project followed it closely and works well!

# More Details

"VU meters" are those little gizmos on your stereo (or other audio electronics)
that show how strong / loud the audio signal is. The "VU" stands for "Volume Units".
There are two basic kinds of VU meter: An "analog" meter, which looks like a dial with a moving needle; and a "digital" meter, which usually looks like a little stack of colored indicator lights about one inch tall -- the more lights are on, the louder the sound. There are usually two VU meters -- one for each channel of your stereo.

Our VU meters are digital, but they are not dinky little one-inch-tall stacks of tiny lights...
each one is about six feet tall and one foot wide.

Each VU meter has ten big, bright L.E.D. lights.
The diffusers on the lights are custom designs, fabricated using our own vacuum thermoforming system.

# Time, Effort, and Expense

We formed a team and the project received the green light at our monthly meeting on July 1, 2013.
The members were Tim F, Emily, and Mick. We expected to have the project finished that summer and work started quickly, but it took longer than that: we installed the meters in the winter of 2013.

This was not a particularly complex project, although it did bring together aesthetics, design, plastics, woodwork, and electronics.

Tim already had some idea of how to create the electronics, since he does that kind of thing for a living. The main project "unknown" was the design of the custom light diffusers. We had originally thought that we would design and 3D-print thin plastic diffusers, perhaps featuring our Davis Makerspace logo. Mick did some very useful 3D-printed experimental diffusers, and Emily and Tim met a few times to brainstorm design ideas. During that early part of the design process, it became pretty obvious that 3D-printed diffusers would either have to be small or made from multiple pieces. Furthermore, it would take a long time and a lot of material to print twenty of them, and their surfaces would be rough.

Tim and Mick discussed alternative ways to crank out twenty diffusers. Whatever technique we would use would have to be fairly cheap, since the electronics and other pieces of the system would use up almost all of our fairly small $150 budget.

The team agreed on the idea of making them using a vacuum thermo-forming system -- more about that system later -- and Tim and Emily designed a simple diffuser. All of the diffusers would have the same shape: a rounded lozenge with a central depression. The depressions would let folks put small lightweight pieces of interesting artwork into the diffusers -- photographic slides, maybe, or 3D-printed figurines or letters that spelled out messages -- thereby making the project more interactive.

Since we didn't have a vacuum thermo-forming machine, nor access to one, we had to build one from scratch. That took a few months, which is probably the main reason why the project took longer to create than we had hoped. But since this project was a volunteer project for our own space, we didn't stress out. After all, the idea was to create something cool, not to create ulcers!

Tim made a master pattern for the diffuser and successfully tested it in the new vacuum thermo-forming system. We had a session in the space to show folks how the vacuum thermo-forming system worked, and then Tim made twenty diffusers plus one spare.

By wintertime Tim had finished assembling and testing both of the Giant VU Meters, and he installed them in the space and sent out email about it.

After a little bit of feedback from members, Tim changed the way that the meters are connected to the stereo. They had been connected directly to the speakers, so that the louder the music, the more lights would turn on. It was sort of a "disco" look... loud music equaled bright lights. But some folks suggested that it would be nicer to have the meters act like the "recording level" meters on a good stereo: a strong musical signal would make more lights turn on, even if you had the volume knob turned down low. That way, you wouldn't have to turn up the music very loud just to show off the pretty lights. And that's the way the meters ended up.

# Liability

Very low. The VU meters use very little power; they will be powered by small UL-listed wall warts or laptop power supplies, which are fairly safe little gadgets. The L.E.D. lights don't run hot.

# Expenses

The project will come close to the limit of $150.00 that the Board has specified for such installation projects.

We will save some money by making the light diffusers with our own 3D printers.

# Next Steps

Progress should be fairly rapid.

Tim has bought all of the electronic and material parts.

Tim has also laid out the basic dimensions of the meters (see the concept sketches in the Resources section of this page):

- Each meter will be 72" tall, 11.25" wide, and 0.75" thick
- Each meter will have ten light diffusers

Emily and Mick can work on the diffusers at the same time as Tim builds the electronics and woodwork.

Tim and Emily have had some discussions of artistic concepts for the diffusers, and Tim and Mick have had a preliminary discussion about 3D-printing the diffusers.

With any luck, this project will be complete this summer. Stay tuned for progress reports!
