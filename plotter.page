So Fire away. This sucker has like a 160 GB disk, and 256 MB RAM so it can spool hella jobs. IT has a jet direct card so you can just point to it, pretty simple. 
Take about 5 minutes to boot, and it does take some minutes to spool up the print job and get things ready, so be patient with it.  

If its wanted we could put a VPN server on the router, and you could VPN in and print to  the plotter from the 'tubes

It is a finnicky little bugger, if it errors out on you things usually just need to be re-seated. 

We do have a torx screwdriver that fits the screws on the back panel. As of Oct 2016 it's rubber banded to the plotter's user manual, but it may float around.
