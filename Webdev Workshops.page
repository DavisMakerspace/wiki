Would anyone like to meet on a semi-regular basis to talk about different Web Development topics and work on small projects together?

Some random ideas for topics we could cover might include... (please feel free to add your own):

- AngularJS
- Less
- HTML5
- Vagrant
- Docker
- Coffeescript
- Bootstrap

Nicholas has offered to host this workshop during his open houses on Wednesday evenings, 5:30pm-7:30pm.

If you're interested in attending (and maybe even leading a discussion) please e-mail Matt Sidor at [matt@mattsidor.org](mailto:matt@mattsidor.org). We hope to have our first session soon! We'll be sure to post details on the calendar when we do.
