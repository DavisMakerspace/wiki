Braden's background is primarily computer science and software, with some dabbling in hardware.

You might ask him about:

* Computer programming, in particular C/C++, Ruby, and Python, plus Bash and Zsh (but he enjoys any language really).
* Using those mini computers out now, like the BeagleBone Black and the Raspberry Pi.
* Linux, in particular Arch Linux.
* Basic digital logic and hardware (he's still learning here).
* Making crème fraîche.

You can contact him directly at braden@davismakerspace.org, or him as well as other makers via the [contact page](http://davismakerspace.org/contact).
