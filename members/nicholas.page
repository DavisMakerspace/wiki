Nicholas is currently the Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer for Davis Makerspace.  As exciting as that sounds he spends most of his time doing the following:

- Programming (mostly Ruby lately, but with pretty wide ranging interests in this area).
- Brewing beer
- Reading technical books most people consider obsolete (Prolog, 4.4BSD Kernel, etc).

He would like to be spending his time doing the following:

- Learning Assembly programming and other low-level stuff.
- Graphics programming (in particular, he would like to implement a ray-casting program at some point in the not too distant future).
- Actually reading some literature again.
- Working through a [Smullyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_smullyan) puzzle book.
