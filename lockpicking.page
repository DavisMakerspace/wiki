title: Lock Picking Workshop Project
categories: projects
...

There is interest in having an (ethical) lock picking workshop, including how one would make their own tools.

One source for tools is to collect the metal pieces that come off of street sweepers, and shape them with a bench grinder.

For practice, we will need locks (and to solicit them in a way so that we don't end up overflowing with locks).

A limited number of locks could be used by grouping people, and/or making a competition out of it.

Competitive aspects could include trying to make the best lock picks, as long as you (1) make them yourself and (2) use tools in the space.
