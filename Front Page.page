# Welcome to the Davis Makerspace Wiki!

[Davis Makerspace](http://www.davismakerspace.org/) is the home of makers in [Davis, CA](https://www.google.com/search?q=Davis%2C+CA).

[We live in the lone alley of Downtown Davis!  It is the gray shed-like building.](http://www.davismakerspace.org/about/location)


## Open Hours

Please list here weekly times you can commit to being in the space.  Any time period is okay (e.g. night owls welcome), just as long as you show up!

Before showing up, be sure to see if there are any exceptions [below](#open-hour-exceptions).  Any last minute exceptions should be broadcast on the mailing list.

* Monday: [beernutsparadox](members/beernutsparadox) (7:00pm - 9:00pm)
* Tuesday: *seeking volunteers*
* Wednesday: Roland (5:30pm - 7:30pm) Contact: (650)387-6084

None of these hours work for you?  Need access to the space for a project?  Ryan has availability at all sorts of odd hours throughout the week, text him and he's likely able to work with you to come open the space at a time that works for you.
