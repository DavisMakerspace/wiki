# Welcome to the Davis Makerspace Wiki!

[Davis Makerspace](http://www.davismakerspace.org/) is the home of makers in [Davis, CA](https://www.google.com/search?q=Davis%2C+CA).

[We live in the lone alley of Downtown Davis!  It is the green shed-like building.](http://www.davismakerspace.org/about/location)


## Open Hours

Please list here weekly times you can commit to being in the space.  Any time period is okay (e.g. night owls welcome), just as long as you show up!

Before showing up, be sure to see if there are any exceptions [below](#open-hour-exceptions).  Any last minute exceptions should be broadcast on the mailing list.

* Monday: (looking for volunteers to hold open hours!)
* Tuesday: Jeff (7:00pm - 9:00pm)
* Wednesday: [Nicholas](members/nicholas) (5:30pm - 7:30pm)

### Surprise Hours

[LucianNovo](members/Lucian Novosel) will be by the makerspace a little earlier than Braden on Saturday 9/14. I'll be there from 12pm to about 4pm, when Braden is scheduled to hold hours. 

### Open Hour Exceptions
