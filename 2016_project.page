Project ideas for a group effort in 2016. Please list any project concepts below. The idea is to have a possible monthly work session to achieve something memorable. 

 - [BareConductive](http://www.bareconductive.com/) - IDK quite what to do with this, but it looks really cool.  Some kind of conductive ink type interactive piece that is exterior to the space and allows the public to mess with it when they walk by. 

>1. An exterior drum kit with paper plates for drums.
>2. Some LED and sounds modulated by midi controller perhaps modulated by public input through sense detection or microphone or something.
